Madan has been extremely instrumental and has been engaged in stabilizing the EM UI throughout this year. He led several feature deliveries by collaborating with other teams (MyA&RSAM) that addressed not only referential integrity issues but also addressed several onboarding adoption friction items.He exhibited great partnership with Product Team in delivering several capabilities that allowed AOs to self-serve for Application Onboarding with improved user experience. He has been always helpful for onboarding team in providing any DB help for their reporting needs. He has been thorough and played critical role in providing justifications for the Auditing RFIs, by closely working with PO and Team. It is always pleasure to work with him and I can safely rely on him for any delivery enquires that I need to put together, this year he exhibited great collaboration and leadership in his engagements and I would like to continue to partner and closely work with him for next year opportunities.

  Madan is the backbone of Entitlement Manager and instrumental in making the Entitlement Manager to reach itâ€™s GA milestone by end of Q3. From the beginning of the year he led several complex features in EM like Onboarding,  EverGreen Journey, Smart Approval API and Integration with EM etc with proper design and analysis in place. He is accountable to the work he takes up on and he is not only thorough from design, development to dev testing in any of the coding projects he does but also manages well documentation around it provides guidance to other developers.  He helped tremendously in running data validations and successfully led the data cleanup project. He helped in overlooking the EM adoption parties having proper collaboration in place with onboarding and business team, which made the effort seamless and successful. 2019 has been a great year, I encourage Madan to lead more technical initiatives, grow as a strong leader in 2020.
